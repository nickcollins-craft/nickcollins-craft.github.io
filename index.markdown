I am a theoretical and computational geomechanician. Specifically, I am interested in localisation behaviours in brittle materials, which typically expresses as cracks or shear bands.

I am currently employed as a Marie Skłodowska–Curie Individual Fellow in the [TRIPOP](https://team.inria.fr/tripop/) team at the Centre Inria de l'Université Grenoble Alpes. Here you can find my publications, codes and data sets, as well as links to my various other online presences.
