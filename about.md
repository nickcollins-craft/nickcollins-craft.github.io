I was born in Sydney, Australia in 1992, and after a fairly uneventful childhood entered North Sydney Boys High School in 2005. I graduated with my Higher School Certificate from there in 2010, and went on to study civil engineering at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-civil-engineering.html).
During my time as an undergraduate, I was financed by a scholarship issued by the then Roads and Maritime Services of the New South Wales state government, in exchange for which I did three (rather than the standard one) internships over each summer break. During these internships I worked on material behaviour research (2011--2012), developer liaison for large private projects (2012--2013) and project management on the large public works project _Northern Beaches Hospital Connectivity and Network Enhancement_. That's about the extent of my engagement with the engineering industry (to this point in time!).
I finished my bachelors degree with first class honours and the University Medal, writing the honours thesis _The Contribution of Granular Rotation to Improving the Efficiency of Heat Transfer_, supervised by Professor [Itai Einav](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/itai-einav.html).

After having taken a brief break, I started my PhD thesis in mid-2015, this time as a cotutelle degree between the University of Sydney and [École nationale des ponts et chaussées](https://ecoledesponts.fr/en), once again supervised by Itai, but also by Professeur [Jean Sulem](https://ecoledesponts.fr/jean-sulem) and (then doctor, now Professeur) [Ioannis Stefanou](http://coquake.eu/index.php/group/) (now at École centrale de Nantes).
My thesis was entitled [_The effect of evolving micro-structural length scale on the macroscopic constitutive behaviour of granular media_](https://hdl.handle.net/2123/22200), and was essentially about developing and implementing a model to predict the formation of structures, referred to as shear bands, within material like sands. These structures occur in a wide variety of materials, but developing a good model for sands was particularly difficult owing to the tendency of the grains to break, which rather complicated the previous models. Nevertheless, we got something worthwhile out, and I defended the thesis on the 22nd of November, 2019 (although the University of Sydney would only recognise its completion several months later, mostly due to administrative delays connected with a certain well-known virus).

Following a delay due to said well-known virus, I started a postdoc in the [TRIPOP](https://team.inria.fr/tripop/) team at the Centre Inria de l'Université Grenoble Alpes (it was called something different at the time, but French institutions feel a need to change their names frequently). During this postdoc, I was supervised by [Vincent Acary](http://tripop.inrialpes.fr/people/acary/) and [Franck Bourrier](https://www6.lyon-grenoble.inrae.fr/etna/MEMBRES/Personnel-permanent/Franck-BOURRIER), working on the topic of non-smooth cohesive zone modelling for fracture in brittle materials like rocks or concrete. This postdoc was financed by the Region Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes through project SMART-PROTECT, and was carried out as a collaboration between Inria, [Inrae](https://www.inrae.fr/en), [Géolithe](https://www.geolithe.fr/) and [Myotis](https://myotis.fr/). This postdoc finished at the end of August 2022, and since the 1st of September I have been a Marie Skłodowska–Curie Individual Fellow, still in TRIPOP, still working with Vincent and Franck, but also with Professor [Johan Gaume](https://www.wsl.ch/de/mitarbeitende/gaume.html) of WSL/SLF and ETH Zürich. My project, Landslide and avalanchE Mechanics with Multiphysical datA (LEMMA) groups together all the techniques I've learned over my career to this point (bulk soil modelling, non-smooth crack modelling) with some new ones (data-driven mechanics, the material point method), to try and get to grip with large alpine mass movements caused by climate change.
